## GitHub Actions Key Concepts

In the context of GitHub Actions, it's essential to understand the following terms:

- **`uses`**: This directive allows you to incorporate an external action into your workflow. Actions can be pre-built by the community or custom-made, and they are used to perform specific tasks within a job.

- **`runs-on`**: Specifies the runner that will execute your jobs. A runner is a virtual machine hosted by GitHub, providing a fresh instance of a virtual environment.

- **`run`**: A command that executes shell commands directly in the runner's environment. This is particularly useful for executing scripts defined in your project's `package.json` or any other shell commands necessary for your workflow.
