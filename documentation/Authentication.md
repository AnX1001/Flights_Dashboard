# Authentication

This app uses NextAuth.js for authentication, with GitHub configured as the OAuth provider. The authentication setup involves a route.ts file, which handles the API routes for authentication by importing and exporting the GET and POST request handlers from auth.ts.

The auth.ts file configures the authentication providers for NextAuth.js, specifically setting up GitHub as the OAuth provider. It also defines additional options, such as session management and callback functions, if needed.
