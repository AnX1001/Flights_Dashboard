# Authentication

This app uses NextAuth.js for authentication, with GitHub configured as the OAuth provider. The authentication setup involves a route.ts file, which handles the API routes for authentication by importing and exporting the GET and POST request handlers from auth.ts.

The auth.ts file configures the authentication providers for NextAuth.js, specifically setting up GitHub as the OAuth provider. It also defines additional options, such as session management and callback functions, if needed.

In this setup, the user session is configured to expire after 5 seconds. The session dialog component monitors the session status every 10 seconds, prompting the user to either sign in or continue as a guest upon expiration.
